# Image-Classification
Repository for Data 3320 project 4.

# Project Description
This project will attempt to train an keras image classifcation models to identify pokemon by their primary elemental types.

# Data
Data used is sourced from Kaggle, which can be viewed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types?resource=download&select=images

Kaggle is an online data science community that encourages the learning of data science through providing various resources. These include datasets such as the pokemon image dataset used for this project.

The features data can be viewed in the pokemon.csv file in this repository, while the image data can be found in the linked Kaggle page.

# Customizing Neural Network
To perform analysis, a neural network for the model is created by letting the model choose random sets of parameters from a predetermined list to test image classification accuracy on. Each trial uses a different set of parameters, and the parameters that yield the best results are noted and used for the final image classification model. 8 trials are done for the parameter sweep.
